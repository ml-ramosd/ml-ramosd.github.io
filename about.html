		<h2>Who Created The Company?</h2>
		
				<p>
					The company was created by Devon Ramos aand his friend Grafton Miller. They founded the company at the young age of 14, and it grew to where it is today.
					The reason the company is named "Ramos Lawncare" is because Devon was the original founder while Grafton joined shortly after.
				</p>
				
		<h2>Why Was The Company Created?</h2>
		
				<p>
					Here at Ramos Lawncare we all have oine vision. To help YOU have the best lawn, so that you can be your best self. 
					Devon was the first in the company to have this vision, with Grafton shortly joining after our founding.
					Now we have over 30 employees with that same vision. 
					That Vision came to fluition as Devon realized one day that he would have less productive days when his lawn was overgrown.
					The reason is that your lawn is the first thing you see when you step outside AND, when you get home.
					Our sole goal is to make sure that you have a beautiful lawn to appreciate every morning, and a beautiful lawn to enjoy every time you get home.
				</p>
